**Almeida, Brazil**

Hey, I’m *Hiago* — a backend-focused developer passionate about building and contributing to free and **open-source** software. I care deeply about creating practical, **high-quality** solutions that genuinely help developers and businesses. Constantly **learning**, **refining**, and **shipping**.

I specialize in designing and building scalable APIs (**RESTful** & **GraphQL**), crafting clean architectures, and publishing well-structured *NPM* packages. I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple, reliable systems — and I love collaborating, sharing knowledge, and coding alongside other developers.

My main stack revolves around [*TypeScript*](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ([*Javascript*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) too) and [*Golang*](https://go.dev/), where I focus heavily on performance, maintainability, and developer experience. I also work with [*Python*](https://www.python.org/).

I’m the creator of [*Rewrite*](https://rewritetoday.com) — an **API-first** SMS infrastructure platform built with a strong focus on developer experience and reliability. I'm also creator of many packages and actively contributor to the [*AbacatePay*](https://github.com/AbacatePay) Open Source and [*Serenity*](https://github.com/serenitysz), continuously exploring new stacks, architectures, and distributed system patterns.

Beyond writing code, I enjoy thinking about system design, API ergonomics, performance optimization, infrastructure, and building products that scale globally. My goal is simple: build things that last, and build them well.
